- 👋 Hi, I’m @ghSocialOnlyLoginsAreSleazy
- 👀 I’m interested in absolutely nothing.  I made this account for sleazy sites that try to do fishing by requiring a GitHub account.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... not of anybody's business.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... absolutely nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you are from one of those sleazy sites... jump off a bridge, find me in the next life after you mend your ways.
